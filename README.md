# Blur Airdrop Season 2 & Greedy Rats: Auto-Farming

Dear participants! We continue our first public Blur farming event. Mining is in full swing! We hope to please the first investors with a decent drop. You can watch the mining process here. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua8bQiCdg74)

As there are many questions about how to participate in this event, we will once again describe the principle of interaction. Our collection on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/greedyratsnft?search[stringTraits][0][name]=RATSPOWER&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=500) is directly linked to this event. The entire amount from the sale of the first 100 rats goes to the bot's pool. At the end of the event, NFT owners will receive a drop proportional to their contribution.

## Drop parameters:

RATSPOWER (RP) - The parameter is proportional to the invested funds: 0.5 ETH = 500 RP.

RPD - Net profit modifier in this series, equal to 70% (0.7).

TIME - The purchase time directly affects the final distribution of rewards. After the purchase within 2 hours, the entire amount is redirected to the pool. The NFT owner does not claim the earned points that were farmed before their purchase.

### Example of work (numbers are given for calculations, they may be inaccurate):

The total pool is 170 ETH. Suppose you invested 0.5 ETH at the very beginning. In this case, your ETH joins the total pool, and now the pool is 170.5 ETH. It mines 3100 Blur points per day, the NFT holder's share is 0.5/170.5 = 0.002932. Accordingly, they can claim 9.0892 Blur points per day. Points are multiplied by the RPD, which is equal to 0.7.

### The expression is:

0.002932 * 3100 * 0.7 = 6.362 - the number of ETH received by the holder per day, which will amount to 190 Blur points per month. Those who invested later do not claim the points already earned. After converting points into tokens, the tokens will be sold, and the NFT holder will receive their share of the profit to their wallet.

## After the drop

You will have one week to sell your NFTs at the purchase price; we will buy and burn them. Participants who do not sell their NFTs will participate in future events under the same conditions.

## Questions

Question: "Why don't we directly take ETH? Isn't that more convenient?"

Transparency

Thanks to the network, it is visible when a user purchased an NFT and the profit they made from it. Other users can directly assess the effectiveness of the platform.

### Web3

Greedy Rats is not just an automation platform. We want to build a web3 ecosystem where every user can find what they need: from airdrops and node installations to participating in Coinlist and earning from social interactions.
Although we have been running the group for 2 years, we are still a young project. We understand that investing in new projects involves significant risk. We encourage material support for our early users with more favorable terms. The x5 modifier multiplies all earned social points and 70% profitability. In later series, these parameters will be reduced due to the burning of unclaimed NFTs, and the value of the first numbers will be significantly higher than the initial face value.

**Question: "Why don't you let us work with the bot directly? Where are the guarantees?"**

The platform will be supplemented, metrics and other conveniences for users in the personal account will appear, which should lead to a wider distribution of the project. The possibility of personal control over functionality is also planned.
At the moment, it is not possible to safely provide software to every user, and, moreover, it does not give them any guarantees and does not protect them from misuse.

**Question: "How will the next events take place?"**

The DAO management form will allow each holder to vote for an event from the list. We will participate in the event that receives the most votes. Proportional placements may be possible in the future.
This will ensure flexibility and transparency in project management and allow participants to influence the development of the platform.
